# mean-showit

<<<<<<< HEAD
I created this webside for the TDDD27 course. 
The site is called item, is it based on the MEAN stack (MongoDb, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS). It is a website where you can sell or buy secondhand items, when you are logged in, you get access to the different items and the email of the owner, so if you are interested in an item, you can send an email to the owner in order to discuss about the item.
